# Coding in VR

## Coding without connecting to a computer

Attempted to set up GitHub Codespaces as a virtual coding environment within a browser, but am not loving the experience so far

2 serious drawbacks have become obvious right away

1. Storing secrets in a file that is included in .gitignore doesn't seem possible, but that is less of an issue than I thought because
2. You are not able to use the terminal in the VS Code window within CodeSpaces...

I am not sure this is going to be an option.

I am tempted to try out the dbt Cloud IDE, since that sends commands to the database to run, and that shouldn't be an issue (like the inability to run anything)
