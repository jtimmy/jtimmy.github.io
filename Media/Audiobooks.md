# Audiobooks

## Organization

## Server

Served by Subsonic, but with a separate account that only has access to the Audiobook folder so that music did not show in the Audiobook app

## Mobile Access

Accessed using the Boodsonic app on Android

Had an issue accessing the library outside of my WiFi network for a while, which ended up being solved by messing with the Toggle Local Address setting in the main menu.
It was frustrating but not a deal breaker because you would pre load a book and then listen for a long time, and only became an issue if you finished a book and were ready to start a next book before you got home
I was having trouble because I listen to Audiobooks exclusively in the car, and only thought about the need to load up the next book while rushing out the door.
